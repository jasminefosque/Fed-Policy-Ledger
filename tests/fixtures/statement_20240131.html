        <p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. 
        Job gains have moderated since earlier in the year but remain strong, and the unemployment 
        rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.</p>
        
        <p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent 
        over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target 
        range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.</p>
